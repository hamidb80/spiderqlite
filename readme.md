# SpQL ðŸ•·
*SpQL* is graph abstraction over SQL. 
Making SQL frictionless by removing the pain of schema changes and bringing the joy of graph theory.

## Initial Motivation
The author found the SQL tables too rigid, and felt something is missing in document-based databases like MongoDB and CouchDB which makes them unconventional to use (not mentioning their wierd query language). At that time, graph databases like Neo4j and ArangoDB made more sense to him. Because his projects were mostly small size, using mentioned databases is not worth it since they require lots of RAM and computational power.

He dreamed of something that is compatible to SQL as it can be used upon SQLite.

## Terminology
Spider (ðŸ•·) is well-known instinct which walks on his network (ðŸ•¸). The network is metaphore for *graph*. Since its actions/queries is converted to SQL, its name may be mix of these 2 words; Hence Sp<sub>ider</sub>QL or SpQL.

## Usage
### as Library
Just converts `spql` to `sql` language.

### as Server
It aims to bring best of SQLite, Neo4j, CouchDB together.

#### Front end

#### Config
To use as server, it is mandatory to provide a config file which is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/) format. You can you the one that use for development or you write your own. The values in config file can be overwritten by environment variables or flags which are passed as command line arguemnts.

You can look `src/config.nim` to see full list of available configs, but for introduction let's take a look at few of them.

```nim
server: ServerConfig(
  host:  v(ctx, "--host", "SPQL_HOST", "server.host", Host),
  port:  v(ctx, "--port", "SPQL_PORT", "server.port", Port),
)
```

The above code says it first looks at if there is any CLI parameter with key of `--host`, if not, look for `SPQL_HOST` environment variable, if can't find it, then look at `server.host` in config file. If still can't find the value, it throws error, saying the config value is missing.

## Query Language
The query language is heavily inspired by Cypher ([query language of Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/5/auradb-enterprise/)), you can think of it as a mix of Lisp and SQL and Neo4j. 

### Syntax

#### Nesting and passing parameters
Nesting can be done in 2 ways:
  1. going next line with indentation
  2. 

#### Ident Def

### With expression

### 

#### Alias
`AS`

#### USE, TEMPLATE

#### ASK, MATCH, FROM

#### TAKE, SELECT, RETURN

##### PARAMS, PARAMETERS

##### Def Node 
`#`

##### Def Edge 
`@`

#### Field access 
`.`

#### Infix

#### Prefix

#### Function Call 
`()`

##### Special functions

- `>>` : 
- `[]` : 
- `[].`: 
- `{}` : 
- `{}.`:

#### GROUP, GROUPE_BY
#### HAVING
#### SORT, SORT_BY
#### ORDER, ORDER_BY
#### LIMIT
#### OFFSET

#### CASE
#### IF

#### Other
- **prefix operators**: 
  - `NOT`: negates
  - `$`:   converts to string

- **infix  operators**: 
  - `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`: common math operations
  - `%`: modulo
  - `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `=>`, `>`
  - `||`: string concatination
  - `LIKE`: string match
  - `AND`, `OR`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR`, `IS`, `ISNOT`: 
  - `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOTIN`:  

- **int**: `321`
- **float**: `321`
- **string**: `"salam"`
- **variable**: `|varname|`
- **ident**: `random_ident`


### Semantic

#### Context

#### Matching by topology

##### Query Strategy File

#### Using template

#### Defining Object Model
##### Guards
